Movie & Series App
This is a React application that allows users to view trending movies and series, book them for later. The application fetches data from a free movie database API and displays the trending content in a dynamic slider. Users can browse all movies and series, book them, and view their bookings on a separate page. The app includes a fully responsive design, making it suitable for all screen sizes and devices.
